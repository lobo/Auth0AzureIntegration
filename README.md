# Auth0AzureIntegration

This sample exposes how to integrate Auth0 into your Windows Azure application for authentication with Microsoft Account.

Actually it is Windows Azure Mobile App example which you can download from Azure portal with changes for integration of Auth0 authentication

I. You need to create Azure Mobile Apps as described in https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-ios-get-started/ ,then you can download Azure test application.

II. Auth0: Configure Microsoft Account as described in https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/microsoft-account

III. Set up Authentication on Azure App Service

Log onto the Azure Portal, click on All Resources, then your Azure Mobile Apps application (from Step 1).  

Click on All Settings, then Authentication / Authorization. Now you are in the right place to be setting up authentication.

Turn App Service Authentication on

Set the action to take when the request is not authenticated to Allow request

Turn the Token Store to on (under Advanced Settings).

Now click on Microsoft Account. Cut and paste the Client ID and Client Secret from Step 2, and select the same boxes as you did in Step 2 – these are the claims you are requesting be provided to you.

IV. Restrict permissions to authenticated users

In your Mobile App's Settings, click Easy Tables and select your table. Click Change permissions, select Authenticated access only for all permissions, then click Save.

V. Auth0: Enabling WAMS add-on for your client

Clients -> your client -> Addons -> Microsoft Azure Mobile Services

NOTE: With App Services/Mobile Apps, the master key is no longer used/required, that is why it is no longer available on the portal. You can just enter some symbols in the field “Master Key”.

Then you can integrate Auth0 into your Azure applocation. 
For this you need to add 
```
pod 'Lock', '~> 1.26'
pod 'SimpleKeychain'
```
to your pod-file

And `Auth0ClientId` and `Auth0Domain` to your Info.plist

#### Important Snippets

Note: All these snippets are located in the `AppDelegate.swift`, `LoginViewController.swift` and `ToDoTableViewController.swift` files.

##### 1. Register the authenticator 
```swift
    let windowslive = A0WebViewAuthenticator(connectionName: "windowslive", lock: A0Lock.sharedLock())
    A0Lock.sharedLock().registerAuthenticators([windowslive]);
```
##### 2. Login to Microsoft Account 
```swift
    A0Lock.sharedLock().identityProviderAuthenticator().authenticateWithConnectionName("windowslive", 
	parameters: nil, success: success, failure: failure)
```
##### 3. Get a delegation token for WAMS as described in https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock-ios/delegation-api 
```swift
  let idToken = ...
  let dictionary = [
            “id_token": idToken,
    A0ParameterAPIType: "wams"]
  let parameters = A0AuthParameters.newWithDictionary(dictionary)
        
  A0Lock.sharedLock().apiClient().fetchDelegationTokenWithParameters(parameters,
    success:success, failure:failure);
```
##### 4. Use the delegation token for WAMS 
```swift
  let client = MSClient(applicationURLString: "https://<Your_Azure_Mobile_App_Name>.azurewebsites.net")
        
  let token = //delegation token
  let userId = //Microsoft Account user id
  let user:MSUser = MSUser(userId: userId)
  user.mobileServiceAuthenticationToken = token;        
  client.currentUser = user;
```
Before using the example please make sure that you change some keys in Info.plist with your data:
- Auth0ClientId
- Auth0Domain
